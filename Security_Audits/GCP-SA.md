# Control categories

## Control categories

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

- Administrative/Managerial controls
- Technical controls
- Physical controls

**Administrative/Managerial controls** address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization. While administrative controls are typically policy based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or physical controls.

**Technical controls** consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.

**Physical controls** include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.

## Control types

Control types include, but are not limited to:

1. Preventative
2. Corrective
3. Detective
4. Deterrent

These controls work together to provide defense in depth and protect assets. **Preventative controls** are designed to prevent an incident from occurring in the first place. **Corrective controls** are used to restore an asset after an incident. **Detective controls** are implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress. **Deterrent controls** are designed to discourage attacks.

Review the following charts for specific details about each type of control and its purpose.

## Audit checklist
It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

**Identify the scope of the audit**

- The audit should:

  - List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.) 

  - Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals

  - Indicate how often an audit should be performed

Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees

**Complete a risk assessment**

- A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

**Conduct the audit**

- When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

**Create a mitigation plan**

- A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 

**Communicate results to stakeholders**

- The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
